# Shippie Action

## Setup

Run the following command in your repo root to add the shippie workflow to your repo.

```bash
npx shippie configure
```

The setup script automatically adds an `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret to your repo. More info on secrets can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

You can configure the workflow to run however you like, but here are some examples.

### Option 1: Review every PR to main

Trigger a code review on any PR into main, updating it each time you push changes.

```yaml
name: Shippie ðŸš¢

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  run_code_review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Shippie ðŸš¢
        uses: mattzcarey/shippie@v0.10.0
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          MODEL_STRING: "openai:gpt-4o"
          REVIEW_LANGUAGE: "English"
```

### Option 2: Assign a shippie bot

In this config, a review is triggered when a specific user is added as a "reviewer" in the Github UI. Create an additional Github account such as 'YourProject-ML-CR-bot', then specify the account username in the config.

This option can save on API costs by only reviewing when explicity asked to. It can also be used to avoid reviewing PRs before they are ready (draft/WIP PRs).

To trigger a re-review, simply remove and re-add the bot to the reviewers list.

```yaml
name: Shippie ðŸš¢

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ review_requested ]

jobs:
  run_code_review:
    if: ${{ github.event.requested_reviewer.login == 'YourProject-ML-CR-bot'}}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
