The function `unawaitedPromise` calls `asyncFunction` but does not await its result. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `asyncFunction` is performing any asynchronous operations that `unawaitedPromise` depends on. Consider using the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve before continuing execution. For example:

```
async function unawaitedPromise() {
    // This is an awaited promise
    await asyncFunction();
}

unawaitedPromise();
```

Also, it's good practice to handle promise rejections to avoid unhandled promise rejections. You can do this using `.catch()` or a try/catch block.
