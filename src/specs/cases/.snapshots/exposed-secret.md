The code exposes a secret key which is a serious security issue. Never log sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or secrets. Consider using environment variables to store such sensitive information. For example:

```typescript
const secretKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY;

function exposeSecret() {
  console.log(`The secret key is: ${secretKey}`);
}

exposeSecret();
```

In this case, the secret key is stored in an environment variable named `SECRET_KEY`. Remember to add `SECRET_KEY` to your `.env` file and never commit the `.env` file to the repository.
