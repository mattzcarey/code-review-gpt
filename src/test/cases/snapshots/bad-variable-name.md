1. The variable and function names are not following the TypeScript naming conventions. It's recommended to use camelCase for variable and function names.

2. Avoid using special characters like `_` and `\` as variable names. It reduces readability and can cause confusion. Use descriptive names instead. For example,`let count = 5;`instead of`let \_ = 5;`

3. Variable names cannot start with a number. `let 123abc = 15;` is invalid and will cause a syntax error. Consider renaming it to `let abc123 = 15;`
